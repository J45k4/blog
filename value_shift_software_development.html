    <h1>Value Shift in Software Development</h1>
    <p>
      Around 2025, when the first models that were truly good at agent work showed up,
      coding agents started to feel genuinely useful.
      Since then, the steady trend has been: better results every iteration.
      If that keeps going, then a GPT-5 level model will be almost free in one year,
      while the best models keep getting noticeably stronger.
    </p>

    <p>
      A concrete example of the cost drop: about a year ago, o1 Standard API pricing was
      $15 / 1M input and $60 / 1M output. Today, GPT-5.2 Standard is listed at
      $1.75 / 1M input and $14 / 1M output. That is roughly 8x cheaper on input and
      4x cheaper on output. Cached input went from $7.50 / 1M to $0.175 / 1M,
      which is about 40x cheaper.
    </p>

    <p>
      If models can handle most routine coding tasks, the value in software development shifts.
      Writing code becomes a smaller part of the job.
      Defining the right problem and validating the solution become the center of gravity.
    </p>

    <h2>A Possible Workflow</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine a product-focused person who gathers customer needs and writes a clear ticket.
      Instead of handing it to an engineer first, they hand it to an AI system wired into the ticketing flow.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>AI makes changes, pushes a feature branch, and opens a merge request.</li>
      <li>If CI passes, the product person deploys to a dev environment.</li>
      <li>They test the feature and verify it matches the intent.</li>
      <li>If something is wrong, they report it to the AI and repeat.</li>
      <li>Once it works, a software engineer reviews for quality and consistency.</li>
      <li>The engineer merges it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Engineer Becomes a Taste Tester</h2>
    <p>
      The engineer role shifts toward taste, quality, and long-term maintainability.
      It is less about writing every line, and more about making sure the final result is solid.
    </p>

    <h2>A New Kind of Product Tester Role</h2>
    <p>
      The person driving the loop does not need deep programming knowledge.
      They need to know the product, test the behavior, and communicate with the agent effectively.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Comfortable using a computer and a terminal</li>
      <li>Deep understanding of the product and its users</li>
      <li>Good at describing issues and iterating with the AI</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In that world, the value is less about typing code and more about defining the right thing,
      testing it, and knowing when it is good enough to ship.
