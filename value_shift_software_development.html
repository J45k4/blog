    <h1>The Value Shift in Software Development</h1>
    <p><em>2026-01-01</em></p>

    <p>
      Around July 2025, with the arrival of GPT-5, coding agents crossed an important threshold.
      For the first time, they felt genuinely capable of handling agentic coding tasks—especially
      in web applications and CRUD-style backend systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since then, the trend has been steady and unmistakable: each new iteration delivers better
      results. If this trajectory continues, today’s GPT-5-level capability may be close to
      commoditized within a year, while the frontier models continue to advance meaningfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pricing shift makes this concrete. About a year ago, o1 Standard API pricing was
      <strong>$15 / 1M input</strong> and <strong>$60 / 1M output</strong>.
      Today, GPT-5.2 Standard is listed at
      <strong>$1.75 / 1M input</strong> and <strong>$14 / 1M output</strong>.
      That is roughly an 8× reduction on input and a 4× reduction on output.
      Cached input dropped from <strong>$7.50 / 1M</strong> to <strong>$0.175 / 1M</strong>—nearly 40× cheaper.
    </p>

    <p>
      When models can handle most routine coding tasks, the value in software development shifts.
      Writing code becomes a smaller portion of the total work.
      Defining the right problem and validating the solution become the center of gravity.
    </p>

    <h2>A Possible Workflow</h2>

    <p>
      Imagine a product-focused person who gathers customer needs and writes a clear, well-scoped ticket.
      Instead of handing it directly to an engineer, they hand it to an AI system integrated into the
      ticketing and repository workflow.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>The AI implements the change, pushes a feature branch, and opens a merge request.</li>
      <li>If CI passes, the product owner deploys it to a development environment.</li>
      <li>They test the feature and verify it matches the original intent.</li>
      <li>If something is off, they report it back to the AI and iterate.</li>
      <li>Once the behavior is correct, a software engineer reviews for quality and consistency.</li>
      <li>The engineer approves and merges the change.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Engineer as a Taste Tester</h2>

    <p>
      In this model, the engineer’s role shifts toward taste, architectural judgment,
      and long-term maintainability.
      The focus is less on authoring every line of code and more on ensuring that the final
      result is coherent, resilient, and aligned with the system’s standards.
    </p>

    <h2>A New Kind of Product Tester</h2>

    <p>
      The person driving this loop does not need deep programming expertise.
      What they need is a strong understanding of the product, the ability to test behavior
      critically, and the skill to communicate intent and feedback clearly to the agent.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Comfortable using a computer, tools, and basic terminal workflows</li>
      <li>Deep understanding of the product and its users</li>
      <li>Skilled at describing issues and iterating precisely with the AI</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In this world, value shifts away from typing code and toward defining the right thing,
      validating behavior, and knowing when the result is good enough to ship.
