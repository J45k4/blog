It is likely that in the future AI will replace more and more jobs. When this happens might be either in the near or far future, it is hard to say. However, it is good to start thinking about what kind of business will benefit from AI and what kind of business will not.

## Current AI analysis
Currently, AI is good at things like:
### GPT
**Good**
- Writing text and translating text
- Remembering a lot of facts even though hallucinations are a bit of a problem
- Doing style transforms on text
- Kind of good at writing code with limited scope
**Bad**
- Things that require long context like making changes to a large codebase. Fundamentally, this is probably a learning problem since humans can learn a codebase and remember changes (kind of) made some time ago and why.
- Things that require continuous learning. Like in the real world, things can change slightly but for humans, it is easy to deal with since humans can quickly learn slight changes but for GPT by design it is impossible. Although it is kind of possible to simulate using some kind of function call to insert memories, it is not very reliable.
- Difficult to retrain; there are problems like "catastrophic forgetting" where the network will forget something important learned before.
- **Moravec's paradox**

**Diffusion Models**
I guess they already generate photorealistic pictures and can create quite good pictures for many things but it is difficult to generate consistent characters and making slight modifications to a character will make too big changes.

### Problem
There is a problem that in many things AI can do pretty well but not quite, and because it cannot finish the job it is kind of "useless". A few examples:
- A non-programmer uses AI to generate code for some website and it's doing pretty well but then there is some small issue that needs to be fixed. Like when pressing a button something specific needs to happen or the layout is slightly wrong and for some reason, AI cannot finish the job. So now the person who cannot program cannot finish the product and in the worst case, the work is useless because it does not do the one specific thing.
- A person who cannot draw is making a cartoon with an AI picture generator. They manage to make a picture with their cartoon characters but they have a hard time keeping the characters consistent and if they want to make a small change to the design it is almost impossible.

## Future AI
Current AI is pretty good at reasoning and doing one-off tasks in the virtual world but it is difficult to do tasks independently for a long time. I guess the main problem fundamentally is that it is difficult to predict what will happen after many steps. One problem is that doing things independently requires continuous learning, for example, imagine you are given a task to do and it is your first time doing it, no matter how easy the task is, the first time doing it would not feel easy or natural. The second time you probably would be a lot better at it. When doing things independently many things are like this and require slight modifications of behavior over time.

However, there is no reason (at least what I could see) that these are fundamentally impossible problems to solve so it is reasonable to assume that future AI will be able to solve these problems.

## Current Works

**Skilled Work**
Theory is not very complicated but physical actions get better with experience.

- Car mechanic
- Welder
- Builder
- Designers
- Frontend developers
- Translators

**Social Work**
These jobs require social skills and some amount of job-specific skills. Also require a certain kind of personality to handle job requirements.

- Child care
- Waitress
- Cashier

**Knowledge Work**
Requires long training for knowledge and the primary method of work is knowledge

- Engineers 
- Teachers
- Lawyers
- Doctors

**Creative Work**
Work value is mostly subjective and there are no clear rules on what makes creative work valuable unless we mean something like creative design or solution that can be objectively verified.

- Creating art
- Creating entertaining videos
- Singers
- Comedians

## Future Work

AI will not eliminate the need for human work overnight but it is likely that gradually it will start doing that. At the moment AI is not really replacing any jobs but can do many parts as good or even better than humans. Next, we will go through different jobs to see what their future could look like.

**Lawyer**
Even at the moment AI could probably do many things lawyers do and even be used as legal assistance in some cases even without the need for a real lawyer. But even if AI gets a lot better can it work in court as a lawyer? Maybe in the future but that is a regulation question.

**Engineers**
Currently, AI is good at answering questions about general topics and can even find bugs in software if the context is limited. It can generate code for many things but the problem is that it does not understand the full context of the project so solutions might feel like they don't fit.

Currently, it cannot really create projects or designs completely like imagine you say design a rocket engine.

## Future Business

So let's assume that AI capabilities are going to improve and over time more and more jobs can be done with AI. What are the potential businesses left after this?

Businesses that rely on some "unique" human characteristics are going to be in danger first. There has been a trend of humans saying that "AI cannot do x" and then later it will do it better than most humans and it seems to continue and humans try to escape into a tight corner. Of course, there are jobs that will likely take longer to replace like replacing a full car mechanic is actually kind of hard. Many times need to fit arms into tight spaces and be in difficult positions. However, things like changing tires and oil are simpler to replace over time this niche will disappear.

What if your business is about productizing existing AI models from leading model developers then when their models improve your product also gets better. This seems nice but there is likely to be a lot of competition and hard to gain a competitive advantage in this.

Selling hardware which is still valuable even when most of the work is done by AI. So if you sell GPUs your business value will increase if interest in AI increases. Even better would be to develop new products which benefit AI. But the thing is that if it is already so general it can do most jobs then almost anything you produce can be used by robots. So it seems the future of the business is hardware.
