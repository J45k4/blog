It is likely that int he future AI replace more and more works in the future.  When this happens might be either in near or far hard to say.  However it is good to start thingking about this what kind of business will benefit from AI and what kind of business will not. 

## Current AI analysis
Currently AI is good at things like:
### GPT
**Good**
- Writing text and translating text
- Remembering lot of facts even though hallucinations are bit of a problem
- Doing style transforms on text
- Kind of good writing code with limited scope
**Bad**
- Things that require long context like making changes to large codebase. Fundamentally this is probably learning problem since humans can learn codebase and remember changes (kind of) made some time ago and why.
- Things that require learning continuously. Like in realworld things can change slightly but for humans it is easy to deal with since humans can quickly learn light changes but for GPT by design it is impossible. Although it is kind of possible simulate using some kind of function call to insert memories but not very reliable.
- Difficult to retrain there are problems like "catastrophic forgetting" where network will forget something important learned before.
- **Moravec's paradox**

**Diffusion Models**
I guess they already generate photo realistic pictures and can create quite good pictures for many things but it is diffiucult to generated consistent characters and making slight modifications to character will make too big changes.

### Problem
There is a problem that in many things AI can do pretty but not quite and because it cannot finnish the job it is kind of "useless". Few examples
- Non programmer uses AI to generate code for some website and it's doing pretty well but then there is some small issue that needs to be fixed. Like when pressing button something specific need to happen on the layout is slightly wrong and for some reason AI cannot finish the job. So now person who cannot program cannot finish the product and in the worst case work is useless because it does not do the one specific thing.
- Person who cannot draw is making cartoon with AI picture generator. They manage make picture with with their cartoon characters but they have hard time keeping the characters consistent and if they want to make small change to design it is almost impossible.

## Future AI
Current AI is pretty good in reasoning and doing one off tasks in virtual world but it is difficult to do tasks independently for long time. I guess the main problem fundamentally is that it is difficult to predict what will happen after many steps. One problem is that doing things independently require learning continously for example imagine you are given a task to do and  it is your first time doing it no matter how easy is the task first time doing it would not feel easy or natural. Second time you probably would be lot better at it. When doing things independently many things are like this and require slight modifications of behaviour over time.

However there are no reason (at least what i could see) that these are fundamentally impossible problems to solve so it is reasonable to assume that future AI will be able to solve these problems.

## Current Works

**Skilled Work**
Theory is not very complicated but phycical actions get better with experience.

- Car mechanic
- Welder
- Builder
- Designers
- Frontend developers
- Translators

**Social Work**
These jobs require social skills and some amount of job specific skills. Also require certain kind of personality to handle job requirements.

- Child care
- Waitress
- Cashier

**Knowledge Work**
Requires long training for knowledge and primary method of work is knowledge

- Enginerers 
- Teachers
- Lawyers
- Doctors

**Creative Work**
Work value is mostly subjective and there are no clear rules what makes creative work valuable unless we mean something like creative design or solution that can be objectively verified.

- Creating art
- Creating entertaining videos
- Singers
- Comedians

## Future Work

AI will not eliminate need for human work overnight but it is likely that gradually it will start doing that. At the moment AI is not really replacing any works but can do many parts as good or even better than humans. Next we will go through different works to see what their future could look like.

**Lawyer**
Even at the moment AI could probably do many things lawyer do and even be used as legal assistance in some cases even without need for real lawyer. But even if AI get's lot better can it work in court as lawyer ? Maybe in the future but that is regulation question.

**Engineers**
Currently AI is good at answering questions about general topics and can even find bugs in software if context is limited.  It can generate code for many things but the problem is that it does not underestand the full context of project so solutions might feel like they don't fit.

Currently it cannot really create projects or designs completely like imagine you say design rocket engine 

## Future Business

So let's assume that AI cababilities are going to improve and overtime and more and more jobs can be done with AI. What are the potential business left after this ?

Business which rely on some "unique" to human characteristics are going to be in danger first.   There has been trend of humans saying that "AI cannot do x" and then later it will do it better than most humans and it seems to continue and humans try to escape into a tight corner. Of course there are jobs that will likely take longer to replace like replacing full car mechanic is actually kind of hard. Many times need to fit arms into tight spaces and be in difficult positions. However things like changing tyres and oil are simpler to replace overtime this niece will dissapear. 

What if your business is about productising existing AI models from leading model developers then when their models improve your product also gets better.  This seems nice but there are likely to be lot of competition and hard to gain competive advantage in this.

Selling hardware which is still valuable even when most of work is done by AI. So if you sell GPU's your business value will increase if interest in AI will increase. Even better would be to develop new products which benefit AI. But the thing is that if it already so general it can do most jobs then almost anything you produce can be used by robots. So it seems future of the business is hardware.
